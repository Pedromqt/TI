# TI
Project made by me for an evaluation 

GAME: Bit Math

The objective of this game is to guess the result of the operation between two numbers encoded in the binary format. One of three binary operations AND, OR or XOR 
is performed, which is indicated from a RGB led color. The result of the operation is indicated by the number of times the button is pressed,
there is a time limit for indicating the number.

I was evaluated in 1.7 out of 2 .
